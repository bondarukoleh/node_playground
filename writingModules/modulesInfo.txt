npm at its core is a set of tools for installing, managing, and
creating Node modules.
Make each program do one thing well, means make your module doing something good but one thing.

npm list - graph of dependency
npm search fibonacci - search existing modules.
npm docs fibonacci - will load a homepage of module in browser


Every module has an entry point: the object/function/constructor that we get when itâ€™s
required elsewhere using the require keyword.
