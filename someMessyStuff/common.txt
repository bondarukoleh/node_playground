Word about npm run.
So when you've set
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint ."
}
and run >npm run-script (same as "run") lint.
It means that node will set up all needed system variables from package.json before command will run. And system
  will know that we have eslint package in node_modules.

It's alike you're run >./node_modules/.bin/eslint . -> means if there an alias to executable file in package - use it.
>./node_modules/.bin/eslint . -> same as run >./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js . In bin it's aliases to packages.

Why ./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js works? -> #!/usr/bin/env node, shebang, that's why, it's an executable by node
file.

It's the same as we'd run with node explicit. >node ./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js .

So >npm run lint not the same as we run >eslint . It will find a nearest bin, parse a modules we need and run the shebang
executable file.
