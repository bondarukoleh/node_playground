Terms:
Layer - A slice of related networking protocols that represents a logical group. The application
layer, where we work, is the highest level; physical is the lowest.
HTTP  Hypertext Transfer Protocol—An application-layer client-server protocol built on TCP.
TCP - Transmission Control Protocol—Allows communication in both directions from the client to
the server, and is built on to create application-layer protocols like HTTP.
UDP - User Datagram Protocol—A lightweight protocol, typically chosen where speed is desired
over reliability.
Socket - The combination of an IP address and a port number is generally referred to as a socket.
Packet - TCP packets are also known as segments—the combination of a chunk of data along with
a header.
Datagram - The UDP equivalent of a packet.
MTU - Maximum Transmission Unit—The largest size of a protocol data unit.

Socket
The combination of a port number and an address is known as a socket. And there are both TCP and UDP sockets.

In Node, you can create TCP sockets with the net module, and UDP is supported by
the dgram module.

Encrypted TCP connections use TLS:
Transport Layer Security. Node’s tls module is implemented using OpenSSL.
This type of encryption is called public key cryptography. Both clients and servers
must have private keys. The server can then make its public key available so clients can encrypt messages.
To decrypt these messages, access to the server’s private key is required.
