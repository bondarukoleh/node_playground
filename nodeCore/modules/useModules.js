/*
What ultimately gets exported in your application is module.exports. "exports" is set
up as a global reference to module.exports, which initially is defined as an empty
object that you can add properties to. exports.myFunc is shorthand for
module.exports.myFunc.
As a result, if exports is set to anything else, it breaks the reference between
module.exports and exports

ATTENTION: Modules are cached globally in Node, so
if we have another file that also requires config.json and we modify it, itâ€™s modified
everywhere that module is used in our application. Better require it,
and work locally with config object.
